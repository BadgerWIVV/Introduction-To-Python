# Prerequisites for attending the event

1. A laptop that you can bring with you to the event.

  - You will probably want to bring a power cable to be safe.

1. A copy of Python installed from [the Python website][downloads].

  - Personally, we recommend installing "Python 2.7.9" ([Windows][],
   [Mac OSX][], and [Linux][]) which is the latest version of Python 2.7 at
   the time of this writing.

  - Please do this as soon as possible.

  - If you have trouble with this please email Ian. His email is available
   [here][sigmavirus24].

1. An interest in learning the Python programming language.

1. A copy of this repository on your machine. You can download a zip file from
   the [releases][] page. Look for a release named 'v1.0' or 'Version 1'.
